classicrt uses jQuery to add a "classic RT" button to tweets on Twitter. Using it on a tweet will copy it to your status, putting "RT @username" in front of it.

It is both a chrom{e,ium} extension (in the chromium directory) and a
greasemonkey user script (in the grease folder). The latter is untested as of the publication of this README.
